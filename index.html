        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          My Name is Adam Chu a First Year Software Engineering Student at
          Solent University.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created this portfolio to show the programs that I have created at
          College and University, I felt doing this would refresh the languages
          that I have used previously as well as promote myself. In this
          portfolio I chose projects that where for specific task like
          Assessements or private tasks that I have taken outside of education.
        </p>
        <p>
          The langauges I have used are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>HTML 5/JS/CSS</li>
          <li>Java</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Mainly when contacting me I use tools like: LinkedIn, Twitter & I also
          use GitHub to store my source code:

        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>
          I used Python initally at College to text compression tasks which
          would involve using a function to compress & decompress text inputted
          via strings. When I did this task I did not know if I was allowed to
          use the libary GZIP at the time so with help from a tutor we created a
          compression algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the concept is based around using enumerate and creates a unique
          identifier based on each word with different identifiers if there is
          capitalisation or punctuation. It then saves these lists under two
          different files one contains a list with the positions of ach word
          using the identifiers which are incrementing numbers. The other file
          is a series of numbers which contains the words and the identifier in
          a (#*2) list. The unzipping function reverses the process to create
          the string and would recreate the original string by cross referencing
          the lists.

        <h2>C++ & Java</h2>
        <p>
          This section of the website is focusing on the tasks that I have at
          College and Uni, which revolved around Object Oriented Programming. In
          the First Task (which was at College) I had to create a Command Line
          application which was a Fruit Machine and it would be written in C++
          and use COUT to create a UI and be easy to operate. The Second Task
          was to create a Java Application using Swing to record and document
          natural disasters under the classifications of: Snowstorm, Tornado &
          Hurricane with the inputs being Windspeed and Temperature.

        <h2>Web Languages</h2>
        <p>
          This portfolio is a task for my first year Web Technologies and uses
          HTML, CSS & JS in which I had to create a reactive website. I have
          used the server side languages of PHP and Python before when dealing
          with GET and POST requests as well as using PDO/MySQLi for Database
          integration. Also I have done JavaScript based web games using the
          Phaser API which has been embed below.
        </p>
        <section id="section4a">
          <h3>PHP</h3>
          <p>
            In PHP I have mainly done database management and other Form
            Management, whilst in the process of learning about the WordPress
            Interface as it is still used for smaller businesses and their
            Websites along with Magento for ecommerce sites.

        <section id="section4b">
          <h3>Phaser JS API</h3>
          <p>
            This Game was created for my final project in College and used
            JavaScript to control, draw & manipulate sprites and this was used
            to create a completely satire game about Donald Trump. I used the
            concept behind Asteroid and created a version of it that ran on the
            Phaser Game Engine, in retrospect I would have added a more
            interactive story mode & new power ups that scale with the game. The
            main problem with this project is that because its not created in
            Unity or a better API I am limited by the use of JS.

          <ul>
            <li>Q & E for Roll</li>
            <li>For Thrust it's W & S</li>
            <li>Spacebar is fire</li>
