## Background
I am hoping to solve the problem of my lack of an access to a record of all of the projects I have completed. This is a problem as it limits the amount of self promotion I can do, because I would have to manually send each project per person.

I would like to create a website which is mobile first mainly due to the decline in Desktop viewing of websites, also using a Dark Colour Theme would be nice as I find it better for mobile devices which use OLED displays and can show 'true black' and blacks better than LED displays.

## Wire Frames
The mobile first aspect of my Website is that it follows a all-on-one page style which emphasises scrolling, when running in desktop mode the navigation bar does not stay fixed with the content where as on mobile it becomes fixed.  This is also true for the Social Media Links where they change orientation based on the device your using as larger icons is better for touch screens.

## Colour Choices
I have am using 2 colours for this project with 2 additional shades each in the format of primary/secondary colour with light and dark. These also have a text colour of white and black respectively. To get these colours I used this colour picker:

[Colour Picker Inline Link](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0&primary.color=424242&secondary.color=4DB6AC)

The colours I am using is:

1. Primary Colour: #424242  
* Primary Light: #6d6d6d
* Primary Dark: #1b1b1b
* Primary Text: #FFFFFF
2. Secondary Colour: #4db6ac
* Secondary Light: #82e9de
* Secondary Dark: #00867d
* Secondary Text: #000000

These were chosen due to my desire for a dark themed websire which uses its dark grey colours to show depth, which is how dark themed websites create depth compared to the colourful and accented light theme website. Most Dark Themes use the darkest colours as a background with lighter colours ontop of it to show the Ribbons, this applied without using 'True Black' is important as LCD displays cannot display 'True Black'. Some Phones and mobile devices can Show 'True Black' with its OLED pannel which allows the dark theme to actually conserve them battery life as well as reducing eye strain on the viewer.

## W3C Validation
I am using the W3C validation tool for VSCode which 'Lints' (cross-references) the code to test the program against the latest implemented W3C rules. This does not apply to libaries that it does not read this important as some API's may not be valid in nature but the Linter does not show an error, when checking for W3C rules I made sure that the code followed the repsective rules like: 'Every img tag must have a respective alt' (W3C, 2019, https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility).

## GDPR
In acordance with the General Data Protection Regulation there will be a created privacy policy which will explain exactly what is being recorded by the website and why it has been recorded. This is important as it legally binding for any website which takes any information to the user. Also I have made any forms on the website use opt-in meaning that the user has given confirmation that the data has not been in anyway taken without consent.

## Copyright and Creative Commons
For any project where I have used external files like sound clips or sprites, I have added in the attribution to the original producer this includes using brand logos like Twitter or LinkedInÂ® who according to there brand guidelines have restrictions on colour and size. For example Twitter state that their logo has to be Blue or White depending on the background, also each Logo is from their websites under a non-profit creative commons license.

## Online and Distance Selling Act
As this website is not an e-commerse or a software selling site and is purely for a non-profit purpose of self-promotion it does not require to conform to this act.

## Evaluation
I have moderately achieved the problem that I have of self-promotion as it reqiures
