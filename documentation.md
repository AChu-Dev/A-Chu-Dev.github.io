## Background
I am hoping to solve the problem of my lack of an access to a record of all of the projects I have completed. This is a problem as it limits the amount of self promotion I can do, because I would have to manually send each project per person.

I would like to create a website which is mobile first mainly due to the decline in Desktop viewing of websites, also using a Dark Colour Theme would be nice as I find it better for mobile devices which use OLED displays and can show 'true black' and blacks better than LED displays.

## Wire Frames
The mobile first aspect of my Website is that it follows a all-on-one page style which emphasises scrolling, when running in desktop mode the navigation bar does not stay fixed with the content where as on mobile it becomes fixed.  This is also true for the Social Media Links where they change orientation based on the device your using as larger icons is better for touch screens.
